Climate change and environmental degradation are an existential threat to Europe and the world. To overcome these challenges, the European Green Deal will transform the EU into a modern, resource-efficient and competitive economy, ensuring:

no net emissions of greenhouse gases by 2050
economic growth decoupled from resource use
no person and no place left behind
The European Green Deal is also our lifeline out of the COVID-19 pandemic. One third of the 1.8 trillion euro investments from the NextGenerationEU Recovery Plan, and the EUâ€™s seven-year budget will finance the European Green Deal.
